matrix.org stickers. It's a simple python scripts using requests so you can
view how to build the http request to list the sticker groups and to
purchase one.

The `stickers.py` script is an example of the matrix.org widgets API for
stickers. This script does the login to matrix and then register with the
scalar.vector.im.

List all the stickers groups and then tries to purchase the `stickman` one.

After that list again all the stickers group and all image names for the
